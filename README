Project Name: FakeNews Detecting Chrome Extension, v 1.0

********************************************************************************

How to Install:
    1) Download all necessary python libraries and JDK, JRE.
    2) In Google Chrome, under "More", hover over "More Tools", and click Extensions.
       Check "Developer mode" and then "load unpacked extension." Navigate to the
       correct file directory and install.
    3) In terminal, run "FLASK_APP=run.py flask run". You might need to download
       Flask.

********************************************************************************

How to Run:
    1) Open a page that you would like to check.
    2) Click the extension logo.
    3) If the program believes that this might be fake news, you will be notified.

********************************************************************************

Brief Explanation of How the Program Works:
    1) Given a url link, extract the text files and store it.
    2) Using a data set of fake news, calculate cosine similarity and make a
       decision.
    3) The user still has the choice of continuing even after the notification.

********************************************************************************

Known Bugs/Issues & Topics to Improve on:
    1) After testing our code, we have concluded that the accuracy is approximately
       60%.
    2) If the user chooses to stop reading, the program does not close the page
       for the user automatically.
    3) May encounter a broken pipe error. This is caused by a browser tab being
       shut down prematurely in consideration of other aspects of the program.

Citations:
    1) On actual implementation and python libraries for Cosine Similarity, we
       consulted
       https://sites.temple.edu/tudsc/2017/03/30/measuring-similarity-between-texts-in-python/
    2) We used a picture of Zuckerberg found online at
       https://www.feelguide.com/2014/07/27/american-king-wall-street-already-knows-that-mark-zuckerberg-will-become-the-worlds-richest-person/
    3) We found the dataset from:
       https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news

Testing:
    One can use the following links to check this program.
    1) From National Geographics:

    2) From Conservative Tribune

    3) From New York Times:
       https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/books/review/peter-baker-obama-the-call-of-history.html

    The results should be: 1) Not Fake, 2) Fake, 3) Not Fake
